### Wuddup!

Call me Chip.

I use Github for various projects, but I'm still getting the hang of things. I haven't used it collaboratively yet *(but would like to eventually!)*.

I have a whole website about me at [chiptumor.github.io](https://chiptumor.github.io/?s). Give it an eye, I've engrained a lot of content to unearth!
